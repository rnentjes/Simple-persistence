Prevayler is a way to persist your object model without the need for a database. All objects live in memory, any change is persisted to a transaction log and after a crash or restart the transaction log is read to restore the model in memory.

This project is a little addition on prevayler to simplify working with it. When using prevayler you have to model every change on your model into a "command" object which will be persisted to disk. With Prevayler-Reference you can use a Dao model and stop worrying about command objects.
